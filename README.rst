Pretalx Openmetrics
==========================

This is a plugin for `pretalx`_.
Exporter for metrics in the Openmetrics format, compatible with Prometheus and other systems.

It will export the total number of submissions currently in the system (except for *draft* or *deleted* submissions) in the Openmetrics format, which can then be scraped by Prometheus or another compatible tool.

Pretalx administrators can create a global URL that will export the metrics for all events, also those that didn't enable the plugin. Event organizers can enable the plugin and then generate a URL that will export the metrics only for their event. The URL contains a random token that is generated by Pretalx, which makes it hard to guess. Should it ever accidentally be be published, then it's possible to reset the link.
